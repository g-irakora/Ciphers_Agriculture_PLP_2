This program is basically an application to join both the farmer and buyer to trade easily or find each each other easily
The first thing the program does after running it asks the user to input their information
Here the programs provides two choices for you to choose upon when inserting ur inputs as a user it provides only two choices (farmer or buyer) if not between the two the program will not continue working that's why we used the while True loop within it(try, except ValueError) to make sure the user is following the program instructions otherwise the program stops
We created the base class called user and subclasses called Farmer and Buyer.Farmers can negotiate directly with buyers in chatbot.
